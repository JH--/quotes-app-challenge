# Quotes Code Challenge 

Build an app that lets people browse inspirational quotes. To generate quotes, you’ll be using this API:

[http://forismatic.com/en/api/](http://forismatic.com/en/api/)

If you find another API you’d rather use to get quotes, that works too!

Your quotes application should provide a clean interface for users to view and rate inspirational quotes. No need to go overboard on the design, but the interface should be intuitive and easy to use. 

Feel free to use whatever tech stack you prefer (Python+Flask / Node+Express).  We’d rather see you build more features using a stack you’re comfortable with than fewer features using a stack you’re just starting to learn.

### Core Features:

- Users can upvote a quote if they find it inspiring 
- Users can downvote a quote if they find it uninspiring 
- When the page loads, you can see a list of the top 5 inspiring quotes and the bottom 5 uninspiring quotes (based on up/downvotes)
- When the page loads, it displays a random list of 20 quotes, with no duplicates, and caches these quotes in localStorage.
- Users can click a button to generate a new list of random quotes (again, with no duplicates).

### Bonus Features

- Use a client side router
- Make it look nice, including on mobile!
